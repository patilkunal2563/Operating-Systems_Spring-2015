Readme

I have tested this program on my machine and It works fine with test.cpp
This program even works fine for allocations above 650*1024*1024
As my laptop configurations may be less some of testcases takes more time (But not too much !)
This is more efficient in mmap calls and calls mmap less number of times in some cases.
Please ignore naive programming style mistakes I haven't used C in last 5 years and this program is result 
of too many sleepless nights for learning low level C programming. But I thoroughly learned and enjoyed this assignement.
